    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: May 2023</p>

    <p>Bevicurious ("we", "us", or "our") values your privacy and the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Bevicurious application (the "App") and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>

    <p>Since our App runs entirely on the client side, we do not collect, store, or process any personal data or information. By using the App, you are not sharing any information with us or any third parties.</p>

    <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>

    <p>Our App is designed to run exclusively on your device, without the need to transfer or store any data on our servers or external platforms. As a result, we do not collect or store any personal information, such as your name, email address, or any other identifiable data.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>Our App does not use or rely on any third-party services that may collect your data. We have designed the App to function independently, without requiring any connections to external services or platforms.</p>

    <h2>3. Security</h2>

    <p>While we do not collect or store any personal information, we still value the security of your data. The App is designed to ensure that all processing and storage of information takes place locally on your device, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, or loss of personal information.</p>

    <h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page, and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
